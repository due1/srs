Deliverable 3

* Introduction

	This document describes the tasks to be performed for, and the constituents
of, the Deliverable 3. Such a document would usually not exist in a real
project documentation. (Similar information would be found elsewhere, for
example, in the Iteration Plan document, however.)

		[Note:]	Do not edit or modify this document. This document is
				managed by your lecturer.


* Goals

	The goals for this sprint are:

	*	To organize a sprint in terms of product backlog, sprint backlog/tasks

			*	Product backlog organization

			*	Tasks and task allocations.

			*	Team collaboration.

			*	Working with Git (branches, team efforts, merging, ...)

	*	To deliver a well-structured software in terms of good package design.

	*	To deliver a (sketch of a) solution for object persistence.

	*	To deliver a (sketch of a) solution for the user interface based on Vaadin.

	*	To deliver tested code.

* Your Tasks

	These are the effective task you'll have to provide for this sprint:

	*	Organize your product backlog (PL, as in previous sprints):

			* PL item prioritization

			* PL item grooming

			* PL item "best-guess" estimation

	*	Organize your sprint:
	
			* Fix the list of PB items for this sprint

			* Split larger PB items into tasks

			* Provide task "best-guess" estimations

	*	Update any documents you have so far, if needed

	*	Structure your code in packages by respecting the SOLID design principles

	*	Provide object persistence; the use of JPA is recommended. (Other approaches are okay, too.)

	*	Provide code for selected user stories (or parts thereof)

			* Production Java interfaces and classes

			* JUnit test classes for the application logic and persistence (not necessarily for the user interface)

* Components of this Deliverable

	The deliverable for this sprint shall encompass:

	*	The product backlog at the beginning of the sprint

	*	The sprint backlog items / task list
	
	*	The list of finished sprint backlog items / tasks

	*	Stable structure in terms of Java packages respecting the SOLID design principles

	*	Production Java interfaces and classes for logical and persistence layer

	*	JUnit test classes, coverage: 95% (UI components excluded)

	*	Run <<<mvn clean package>>> and check the following reports (and act accordingly):

			* The test coverage (JaCoCo) report

			* The JDepend report

			* The Checkstyle report

	[]



* Evaluation

	50 points at most per team member are attributed to this deliverable. Points may
not be equally distributed among team members. (However, this is the goal.)



* Deadline

	This deliverable is due: See {{{./sprints.html}Sprint Plan}}.

	[Note:]	Deadline is Friday evening. However, you can provide
			your deliverable till the following Sunday evening, 12 pm.
